and the activities are represented by mathematical functions that interrelate The

A second distinction will be between stelic models and dynamic modern 
models can only show the values that system attributes take when the system is in 
balance. Dynamic models, on the other hand, follow the changes over time that 
result from the system activities. 
In the case mathematical models, a third distinction is the technique by which 
the model is solved, that is, actual values are assigned to system attributes. A 
distinction is made between analytical and numerical methods. Applying analytical 
techniques means using the deductive reasoning or mathematical theory to solve ak 
model. ln practice, only certain forms of equations can be solved. Using analytical 
techniques therefore, is a matter of Ending the model that can be solved and best 
Qts the system being studied. For example, linear differential equations can be 
solved, Knowing this, an engineer who restricts the description of a system to that 
form will derive a model that can be solved analytically. 
Numerical methods involve applying computational procedure to solve 
equations. To be strictly accurate, any assignment of numerical values that uses 
mathematical tables involves numerical methods, since tables are derived number.
